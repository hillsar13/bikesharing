# Bikesharing

## Purpose
We had several intentions for this analysis for an eventual presentation to pitch to investors. We began by using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we created a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

We created our final presentation which can be viewed in the following links:

## Results
The following visualizations were pulled from the Tableau links:

### Visualization 1: This visualization shows the length of time the bikes were checked out. Our visualization shows a majority of total rides lasted under 60 minutes.

### Visualization 2: This visualization shows the length of time the bikes were checked out by gender. Our visualization shows a higher count of  'Male's checking out bikes versus 'Females'.

### Visualization 3: This visualization shows the trips by weekday per hour. Our visualization highlights peak times of travel (typical prior and post the standard 9-5 work day) and a slight spike in use over the weekend.

### Visualization 4: This visualization shows the trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour). Out visualization highlights the gender descrepancy we initially say in V1, but further exmplified in V4.
